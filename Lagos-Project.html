        <strong>Lagos,</strong> sometimes refered to as <strong>Lagos State</strong> to distinguish it fom Lagpos
        metro political area, is a state is the south westhern geopolitical zone of nigeria. The smallest
        in area of Nigeria's 36 states,Lagos State is arguably the most economically important state of
        the country, containing Lagos, the nation's largest urban area. It is a major financial
        centre and would be the fifth largest economy in Africa, if it were a country.

        The actual population total is disputed between the official Nigerian Census of 2006 and a much
        higher figure claimed by the Lagos State Government. Lagos State is bounded on the north and east
        by Ogun State. In the west it shares boundaries with the Republic of Benin. Behind its southern
        borders lies the Atlantic Ocean. 22% of its 3,577 km2 are lagoons and creeks.

        Modern-day Lagos is now a state in South-Western Nigeria. It is bounded on the west by the Republic of Benin, to
        the north and east by Ogun State with the Atlantic Ocean providing a coastline on the south. Lagos is made up of a
        collection of islands surrounded by creeks that fringe the mouth of the Lagos lagoon on the southwest. It is
        separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a stretch of loosely connected barrier islands and sand spits.

        <h1>Name of Lagos</h1>
    </a>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Lagos means <q>lakes</q> in Portuguese, the language of the first European-settlers known to visit the
        settlement, then already inhabited by the Awori and Bini. [1] From the first contacts with the region until the early 20th
        century, another Portuguese name for the city that was interchangeably used was Onim,[2] finally abandoned in favor of
        Lagos. Another theory is that Lagos was named after the city of the same name in Portugal which at the time was a major
        maritime hub for seafaring activity on the Atlantic Ocean. Although Lagos translates to "lakes" in Portuguese,
        there's no lake in the proximity of Lagos; Lagos is an Island. <q>Lagos</q> comes from the Portuguese word
        <q>Lagodikuramo</q>, (meaning "Calm-water"). Consistent with the serenity of coastal water. And, as usual
        practice, it was the British colonialist Lord Lugard who suggested abbreviating the name to <q>Lagos</q> as to rhyme with
        their tonal preference. <sup>[clarification needed][citation needed]</sup>

        From the crowning of Ado as its first Oba, Lagos (then called Eko) served as a major center for slave-trade,
        from which then Oba of Benin Ado and all of his successors for over four centuries supported - until 1841, when Oba Akitoye
        ascended to the throne of Lagos and attempted to ban slave-trading. <br><br>
        Local merchants strongly opposed the intended move, and deposed and exiled the king, and installed Akitoye's
        brother Kosoko as Oba.[3] <br><br>
        At exile in Europe, Akitoye met with British authorities, who had banned slave-trading in 1807, and who
        therefore decided to support the deposed Oba to regain his throne. With the success of the British intervention, in 1851
        Akitoye was reinstalled as Oba of Lagos. In practical terms, however, British influence over the kingdom had become
        absolute, and ten years later, in 1861, Lagos was formally annexed as a British colony.

        The British annexed Lagos as a colony in 1861. The remainder of the Benin Empire - i.e., modern-day Nigeria -
        were seized by the British in 1887, and when the British established the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914, Lagos
        was declared its capital.<br><br>
        Lagos maintained its status as capital when Nigeria obtained its independence from Britain in 1960. Lagos was
        therefore the capital city of Nigeria from 1914 until 1991, when it was replaced as Federal Capital Territory by planned
        city of Abuja, built specifically for such purpose.

        Until today, the Oba of Lagos is the head of all the Kings in Lagos State and his status is different from other
        Obas most of whom were later given back their crowns and staff of office only within the last 40 years. Those who got
        their crowns back were the original land owners (Olofin's children). <br><br>

        The present day Lagos state has a higher percent of this sub-group who allegedly migrated to the area from
        Isheri along the Ogun river. History has it that the Awori were actually from Ife, the cradle of Yorubaland. The Awori people
        are a peaceful people initially not taken to warfare. Due to war, those from the hinterlands, like the Ekiti, ran
        towards Isheri, which at that time had more than one Olofin who were heads of settlements about 1400AD. <br><br>
        When the people fled from the hinterlands most of them scattered again, some to Iro, to Otta, Ado, others to
        Ebute Metta i.e. three landing places - Oyingbo, Iddo Island and Lagos Island (Eko). The Olofin that brought those who went
        to Ebute-Metta was Ogunfunminire, later known as Agbodere. With the full commencement of the war about 2000 moved
        to Iddo Island, others to Otto Awori or Otto Ijanikin towards modern-day Badagry. Those from Ekiti Aramoko came to
        Ebute-Metta, Iddo and then Ijora. <br><br>

        After the demise of Agbodere, the name Olofin became the name used to remember him; the title of Oloto was given
        to his successor. When one of his sons becoming the Oloto his other children parted ways to what is known as visible
        settlements in present-day Lagos.<br><br>

        Until the coming of the Benins, Lagos's geographic boundary was Lagos Mainland. Lagos Island, the seat of the
        Oba of Lagos, then consisted of a pepper farm which belonged to the Aromire family (One of Olofin's sons) and fishing
        posts. No one lived there. The name Eko was given to it by its first king, Oba Ado, during its early history; it also saw
        periods of rule by the Kingdom of Benin. <br><br>

        Eko was the land area now known as Lagos Island where the king's palace was built. The palace is called Iga
        Idunganran, meaning "palace built on the pepper farm". Oba Ado and the warriors from Benin, as well as some of the
        indigenous people who sought safety, settled down in the southern part of Eko, called Isale Eko. "Isale" literally means "bottom",
        but must have been used to indicate downtown (as in Downtown Lagos).

        The first king of Lagos, Oba Ado, apart from having two sons also had a daughter Erelu Kuti, who begat Ologun
        Kutere, who later became king. Shokun his brother, who was more aggressive and whom the Erelu suspected could plan a
        palace coup, was given a chieftaincy title, "Onile-gbale", and a palace just behind the king's palace. This was the
        first time that a Chief would be appointed and installed at the same time as a King's coronation.

        Oba Akitoye who ceded Lagos to the British was Oba Kosoko's uncle. Oba Akitoye was the first Oba not to be
        buried in Benin. Prior to this, all the Kings of lagos were buried in Benin. They passed on taxes to the Oba of Benin
        until the British came and explained that there was no need to send taxes to Benin anymore since they were no longer under
        Benin suzerainty. It was during his reign that the direct influence of Benin on Lagos ended.<br><br>
        Oba Kosoko believed in the slave trade and was at loggerheads with the British, hence his dethronement and flight, first
        to Badagry and later to Epe, Nigeria where he founded kingdoms that still exist today.

        Modern-day Lagos was founded by the Awori in the thirteenth century. It was later called Eko. The Portuguese explorer
        Ruy de Sequeira who visited the area in 1472, named the area around the city Lago de Curamo; the present name is
        Portuguese for "lakes". An alternate explanation is that Lagos was named for Lagos, Portugal - a maritime town which
        at the time was the main center of the Portuguese expeditions down the African coast and whose own name is derived
        from the Celtic word.
